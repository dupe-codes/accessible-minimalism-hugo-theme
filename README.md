# Accessible Minimalism Hugo Theme

Minimalist Hugo theme with a penchant for accessibility 

## Project aims

 - HTML 1 and HTML 5 valid code
 - minimal bloat in the generated markup
 - focus on accessibility
   - semantic, minimal markup for screen readers
   - minimal CSS for high contrast viewing
   - easy to read source code
   - minimal config required to get started and use in Hugo
 - RSS subscription support
 - mobile-last development 

## Who is this for?

This aims at users who care more about content and inclusivity than dancing baby
 GIFs or whatever the 2020 equivalent is.

The early web was great for content, unburdened by MBs of JavaScript or CSS.
 RSS feeds allowed users to pull your content on demand vs being forced into
 giving you space in their precious inbox or following your social-ills.
